# bta-release-api
This project provides a RESTful API for creating, managing, and distributing releases generated by the BTA! project, such as jarfiles, JSON manifests, and instances compatible with MultiMC and other launchers. It uses the Rust programming language, with the `axum` library used for networking and `rusqlite` used to provide an SQLite database.
